Android App : Shazam Tag Viewer
Sean Hodges, 2011

The aim was to complete an application for Android that would provide a table of tags for a 
given user, and provide a means to drill down into the tag details for each result. 

The requirements for this app are:

- Android 2.2 or above
- Supported screen sizes: QVGA, HVGA, WVGA
- The APK requires the INTERNET permission


The project consists of 2 activities and an ASyncTask:

UsernameEntryActivity
---------------------
The entry point for the application, allows user to enter a username and pass it to the 
UserTagListActivity.

UserTagListActivity
-------------------
Interacts with LoadUserTagsTask and displays the tag list on the screen. 
Selecting a row opens the selected tag details in the default browser.

LoadUserTagsTask
----------------
A background task for interacting with the server and parsing the returned data


Other notable components:

HttpShazamDriver is responsible for communicating with the RSS server and retrieving the 
results, using the HttpClient provided in the Android platform.

RssFeedReader is a SAX parser for processing the RSS XML, it converts the into a set 
results into a set of POJO's for inclusion in the tag list activity.

Activity transitions are handled by the IntentDelegate, this keeps the application workflow in 
one place.
